# rock-paper-scissors
Created Rock Paper Scissors game as I was learning JavaScript.

Used querySelectors and eventListeners to execute upon clicking the icon.

When the click was triggered, I coded a function to select the computer choice using Math.random between a selected range of numbers.

I then created a function to compare user choice versus computer choice - where I used switch statements to determine the outcome.

I displayed the scores at the top of the screen and displayed a message to show the user both choices and whether they won or lost.
